## 📌 Introduction

The Vole Machine Language Simulator GUI is a graphical application designed to simulate the operations of a simple CPU. Built with Qt, it provides users with the ability to load instructions, view and edit memory, monitor register states, and perform operations such as fetch, decode, and execute. This tool is intended for educational purposes, aiding in the understanding of basic CPU functionality and object-oriented programming principles.

## 🚀 Features

- **Memory Management**: Visual representation of memory cells, supporting hexadecimal, binary, and integer views.
- **Register Management**: Display and management of registers with detailed formats.
- **Instruction Execution**: Load, decode, fetch, and execute instructions with step-by-step control.
- **Manual Instruction Input**: Option to manually add, decode, and execute instructions without fetching from memory.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive Qt-based GUI with a dedicated 'How to Use' window for user guidance.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## ⚙️ Vole Machine Language Instruction Set
| **Opcode** | **Format** | **Description** |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1      | RXY    | **LOAD** the register R with the bit pattern found in the memory cell whose address is XY. |
| 2      | RXY    | **LOAD** the register R with the bit pattern XY. |
| 3      | RXY    | **STORE** the bit pattern found in register R in the memory cell whose address is XY. |
| 4      | 0RS    | **MOVE** the bit pattern found in register R to register S. |
| 5      | RST    | **ADD** the bit patterns in registers S and T as though they were **two’s complement representations** and leave the result in register R. |
| 6      | RST    | **ADD** the bit patterns in registers S and T as though they **represented values in floating-point notation** and leave the floating-point result in register R. |
| 7      | RST    | **OR** the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R. |
| 8      | RST    | **AND** the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R. |
| 9      | RST    | **EXCLUSIVE OR** the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R. |
| A      | R0X    | **ROTATE** the bit pattern in register R one bit to the right X times. Each time place the bit that started at the low-order end at the high-order end. |
| B      | RXY    | **JUMP** to the location in the memory cell at address XY if the bit pattern in register R is equal to the bit pattern in register number 0. Otherwise, continue with the normal sequence of execution. |
| C      | 000    | **HALT** execution. |
| D      | RXY    | **JUMP** to instruction in RAM cell XY if the content of register R is greater than (>) the content of register 0. Data is interpreted as integers in two's complement notation. |

## 🛠️ Getting Started
### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Qt Framework**: Ensure that Qt (version 5 or later) is installed on your system.
- **C++ Compiler**: A compatible C++ compiler is required.
- **CMake**: Optional, if you prefer using CMake as the build system.

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/esraa-emary/Vole-Machine-Language-Simulator-GUI.git
   cd Vole-Machine-Language-Simulator-GUI
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Ensure that CMake and Qt are installed.
   - Create a build directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir build && cd build
     ```
   - Run CMake:
     ```bash
     cmake ..
     ```
   - Compile the project:
     ```bash
     make
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./Vole-Machine-Language-Simulator
   ```

### 📥 Download the Latest Release

- Get the latest version of **Vole Machine Language Simulator GUI**: [Download Here](https://github.com/esraa-emary/Vole-Machine-Language-Simulator-GUI/releases/latest) <br>
Visit the release page to download the precompiled binaries for your system. Extract the downloaded file and run the executable to start using the simulator!

## 📌 Usage

1. **Load Instruction File**: Use the 'Open Instruction File' button to load a Vole machine code file in `.txt` format.
2. **Fetch and Decode**: Click 'Fetch' to load the instruction into the Instruction Register, then click 'Decode' to parse it.
3. **Execute**: Use the 'Execute' button to run the decoded instruction, updating memory and registers accordingly.
4. **Control Execution**:
   - 'Run One Cycle': Execute a single instruction cycle.
   - 'Run Until Halt': Continuously execute instructions until a halt condition is met.
5. **Reset and Clear**: Options are available to reset the program counter or clear memory and registers as needed.
